		“Stay, Bridgett, I’m frightened as never before,” Hope answered. “But say nothing, lest you become involved as well.” We drew away from the small, frosted windows of our cottage and awaited Jonathan Harding’s knock.
		When I first heard the vile rumors concerning my sister Hope, I hastened to our cottage, gathered Hope’s cat, carried it into the woods, and released it. Bathsheba might be regarded as a witch’s familiar and used as evidence against Hope. The harsh winter snows had slowed the process, but already nine women had been accused, convicted and executed in the previous ten months. I have little doubt that many of the misfortunes that have befallen the families of Salem, including the disappearance of loved ones, are the work of witches, but is it possible that so many of us have turned to Satan? Might the court have erred in its zeal to find the truly guilty?
